# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Anish!!!

ðŸ‘€ I'm an aspiring full-stack engineer with a first-class degree in computer science BSc (Hons) from Royal Holloway, University of London. I also have a keen interest in AI/ML and Cyber security. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the process of completing a full-stack developer course with Codecademy, to strengthen my skills and develop a better foundational understanding of how systems work across the entire stack and learn new frameworks along the way. During this time, I will be working on a number of small projects and a few bigger projects which you can see in this repository.

Outside of the world of tech, I like to spend time with my friends, travel around the world, learn about new cultures - trying new cuisines, meeting new people etc.

Although I am learning more about full-stack development, I already have experience using several different programming languages and have previously worked briefly across the entire stack. Some of these languages include:

* Java (**Main Language**)
* Python (NumPy/SciKit Learn)
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* Haskell

Feel free to explore my repo for projects that I am currently working on.
