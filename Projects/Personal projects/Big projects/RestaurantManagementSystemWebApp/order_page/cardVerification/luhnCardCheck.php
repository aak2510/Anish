This algorithm is available in the public domain, however it has been adapted
to fit in with the purpose of this implementation.

/**
 * The luhn check is a checksum 10 algorithm. This means we perform
 * Some sort of calculation (described below and in the comments), 
 * and then we check to see that the result of this calculation mod 10 
 * is equal to 0. This algorithm is used by many, in real-world applications.
 * 
 * 1. Double the value of every other digit from right to left, beginning with the second to last digit.
 * 2. Add the digits of the results of Step 1 to the remaining digits in the credit card number.
 * 3. If the result mod 10 is equal to 0, the number is valid. If the result mod 10 is not equal to 0, the validation fails.
